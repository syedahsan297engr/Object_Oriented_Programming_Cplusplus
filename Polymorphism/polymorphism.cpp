/*
The reason for the incorrect output is that the call of the function area() is being set once by the compiler as 
the version defined in the base class. This is called static resolution of the function call, or static linkage - 
the function call is fixed before the program is executed. This is also sometimes called early binding because 
the area() function is set during the compilation of the program.

But now, let's make a slight modification in our program and precede the declaration of area() in the Shape class 
with the keyword virtual so that it looks like this âˆ’
